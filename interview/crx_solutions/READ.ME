Dear CRX team,

please use the following commands to run the solutions to the tasks.

Task 1. 
$ cd hills_proj
$ g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o hills
$ ./hills

Note. Surprisingly, but there is a solution that runs in O(n) time and O(1) of extra space.
Note 2. Meanwhile, i think ive got a PhD in water supply over the weekend.


Task 2.
$ cd ..
$ cd drawCircle
$ javac DrawCirle.java && java DrawCirle

Note. The output picture will be in the same fodler as the DrawCirle.class file.


Thanks,
Sergey
