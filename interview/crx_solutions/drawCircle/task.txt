Task 2: Write a program in java that requests for the following inputs and then outputs an image of a black circle in white background in png.

 

Inputs:

  - Radius of the circle in pixel: r

  - Thickness of the circle in pixel: d

  - Center of the circle in pixel coordinate: x, y

  - Size of the image in pixel: h, w

 

Outputs:

  - circle.png

 

Additional considerations:

  - The input will be given such that the circle is fully contained in the image.

 

Hint:

  - Feel free to use external libraries to do everything else except for the function to draw the circle.

  - Assume that you only have 5 hours to provide your solution.

  - It goes without saying that we are looking beyond simply just a correct solution.
